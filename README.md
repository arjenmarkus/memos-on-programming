# Memos on programming


## On the name "wisconst"
Sometimes you come across a seemlingly simple programming problem and think
it might be fun to analyse it: consider the costs in terms of memory use or
amount of code involved, compare different algorithms or implementations.
And, of course, you can read all manner of text books on any variety of
such problems.

I do not pretend that this project will offer new insights in whatever
programming problems it will contain. It is merely for mty own curiosity
and perhaps it may amuse other people.

The PDFs of the notes are found in the "doc" subdirectory. The Latex source files,
sample programs and such are contained in the "src" directory.
